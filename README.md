# R mini projects

The purpose of this repository is to show  *mini* projects, complementary materials (for my `SQL` and `Viz` mini projects), or full scripts in `R`. 💾   
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
 > Well, I define mini project as files-scripts where I can practice:
 - Explore Data 🗺  
 - Analyze Data 🔬
 - Transform Data ⚒ 
 - Visualize Data 🖼  
 - Web Scraping 🌎
 - Ad Hoc 🙋‍  

**How about full projects?** ❔  
The `Tidyverse` gives you all the flexibility and power to do full projects making the usage of SQL or another BI tool unnecessary, but I want to improve in all the areas. That is why I will be using `R + Tidyverse` as a complementary tool and from time to time use it for full projects.
